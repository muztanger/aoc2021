# Advent of Code 2021

This year I am learning Rust and Github Codespaces at the same time as I am doing Advent of Code.

## Thoughts

Getting started with Codespaces was a really nice experience. Easy to setup with a template already in place for development in Rust.

After a couple of AoC problems I realized that I needed more Rust basics and did all the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises. Really good way to get started. The experience of using Rust for this is now much better. ðŸ˜„
