# Advent of Code 2021

This year I am learning Rust and Github Codespaces at the same time as I am doing Advent of Code.

## Thoughts

After a couple of days I realized that I needed more Rust basics and did all the [Rustlings|https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings] exercises. Really good way to get started. The experience of solving the Advent of Code problems are now much better. ðŸ˜„
